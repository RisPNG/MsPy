# MsPy
MsPy, or as I like to call it, Ms. Python, is a collection of unmodified as well as stripped binaries extracted from mise-en-place/asdf.

I mainly use this repository to deliver small portable Python instances inside a project.

I have a similar repository called [WinPython-Mini](https://github.com/RisPNG/winpython-mini) derived from the original [WinPython](https://github.com/winpython/winpython) but this will be used this point forward.
